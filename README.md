# Persian Semantic Search
> First Semantic Search for Persian based on Transformers 

This project was made based on the Transformer models. The semantic search operation tested on three different scopes:

- [Jobinja](https://jobinja.ir/), is a well-known job search system in Iran in favor of job seekers and recruiters. The dataset consists of 9,952 job offers.
- [Taaghche](https://taaghche.com/), consists of books' meta-information available on Taaghche as of 2019 (around 4,505 books).
- Universal, includes a huge range of topics from many sources, [DigiMag](https://www.digikala.com/mag/), [Chetor](https://www.chetor.com/), [Wikipedia](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/fawiki/latest/), [Ninisite](https://www.ninisite.com/), [1Pezeshk](https://www.1pezeshk.com/), and some others. For this particular example, we used only 44,000 records (out of 807,185 documents).

## Notes:
- *You can see the results in the video. Also, it is important to mention that the whole dataset and code would publish soon*
- *For creating a real scenario some misspelling and grammatical errors happened in the demo.*
